- Task 1: Get Connected
	- Ready? Let's get going!
[[]]		- No answer needed
- Task 2:
	- What does NFS stand for?
		- Network File System
	- What process allows an NFS client to interact with a remote directory as though it was a physical device?
		- Mounting
	- What does NFS use to represent files and directories on the server?
		- file handle
	- f
- Task 3: Enumerating NFS
	- Conduct a thorough port scan scan of your choosing, how many ports are open?
		- ![[Pasted image 20250111074703.png]]
		- 7
	- Which port contains the service we're looking to enumerate?
		- 2049
	- Now, use /usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP] to list the NFS shares, what is the name of the visible share?
		- ![[Pasted image 20250111074724.png]]
		- /home
	-  Time to mount the share to our local machine!
	- First, use "_mkdir /tmp/mount_" to create a directory on your machine to mount the share to. This is in the /tmp directory- so be aware that it will be removed on restart
	- Then, use the mount command we broke down earlier to mount the NFS share to your local machine. Change directory to where you mounted the share- what is the name of the folder inside?

		- Cappucino
	- Have a look inside this directory, look at the files. Looks likeÂ  we're inside a user's home directory...
		- No answer needed
	- Interesting! Let's do a bit of research now, have a look through the folders. Which of these folde**rs** could cont**a**in keys that would give us remote access to the server?
		- ![[Pasted image 20250111074901.png]]
		- .ssh
	- Which of these keys is most useful to us?
		- id_rsa
