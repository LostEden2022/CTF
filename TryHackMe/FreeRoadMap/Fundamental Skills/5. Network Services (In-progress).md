- Task 1: Get Connected
	- Ready? Let's get going!
		- No answer needed
- Task 2: Understanding SMB
	- What does SMB stand for?
		- Server Message Block
	- What type of protocol is SMB?
		- response-request
	- What do clients connect to servers using?
		- TCP/IP
	- What systems does Samba run on?
		- Unix
- Task 3: Enumerating SMB
	- Conduct an **nmap** scan of your choosing, How many ports are open?
		- ![[nmap -sS 10.10.22.206.png]]
	- Used nmap -sS (SYN Scan) on 10.10.22.206 for a quick, stealthy, and accurate scan. 
		- 3
	- What ports is **SMB** running on?
		- 139/445
	- Let's get started with Enum4Linux, conduct a full basic enumeration. For starters, what is the **workgroup** name?
		- ![[enum4linux -a 10.10.22.206.png]]
		- ![[enum4linux output 1.png]]
		- WORKGROUP
	- What comes up as the **name** of the machine?
		- POLOSMB
	- What operating system **version** is running?
		- 6.1
	- What share sticks out as something we might want to investigate?
		- ![[enum4linux output 2.png]]
		- profiles
- Task 4: Exploiting SMB
	- What would be the correct syntax to access an SMB share called "secret" as user "suit" on a machine with the IP 10.10.10.2 on the default port?
		- smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445
	- Great! Now you've got a hang of the syntax, let's have a go at trying to exploit this vulnerability. You have a list of users, the name of the share (smb) and a suspected vulnerability.
		- No answer needed
	- Does the share allow anonymous access? Y/N?
		-  ![[Pasted image 20241222084214.png]]
		- Y
	- Great! Have a look around for any interesting documents that could contain valuable information. Who can we assume this profile folder belongs to?
		- ![[Pasted image 20241222084340.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241223074527.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241223075029.png]]
		- John Cactus
	- What service has been configured to allow him to work from home?
		- ssh
	- Okay! Now we know this, what directory on the share should we look in?
		- .ssh
	- This directory contains authentication keys that allow a user to authenticate themselves on, and then access, a server. Which of these keys is most useful to us?
		- ![[cd .ssh followed by ls.png]]
		- id_rsa
	- Download this file to your local machine, and change the permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]".
		- ![[Pasted image 20241224075137.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241223081545.png]]

	- Or
		-  ![[Pasted image 20241224080747.png]]
	- Now, use the information you have already gathered to work out the username of the account. Then, use the service and key to log-in to the server.
		-  cactus@polosmb
		- ![[Pasted image 20241224080804.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241224080922.png]]
	- What is the smb.txt flag?
		- THM{smb_is_fun_eh?}
- Task 5: Understanding Telnet
	- What is Telnet?
		- application protocol
	- What has slowly replaced Telnet?
		- ssh
	- How would you connect to a Telnet server with the IP 10.10.10.3 on port 23?
		- telnet 10.10.10.3 23
	- The lack of what, means that all Telnet communication is in plaintext?
		- encryption
- Task 6: Enumerating Telnet
	- How many **ports** are open on the target machine?
	- What **port** is this?
	- This port is unassigned, but still lists the **protocol** it's using, what protocol is this?
	- Now re-run the **nmap** scan, without the **-p-** tag, how many ports show up as open?
	- Here, we see that by assigning telnet to a **non-standard port**, it is not part of the common ports list, or top 1000 ports, that nmap scans. It's important to try every angle when enumerating, as the information you gather here will inform your exploitation stage.
	- Based on the title returned to us, what do we think this port could be **used for**?
	- Who could it belong to? Gathering possible **usernames** is an important step in enumeration.
	- Always keep a note of information you find during your enumeration stage, so you can refer back to it when you move on to try exploits.
