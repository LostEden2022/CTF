- Task 1: Get Connected
	- Ready? Let's get going!
		- No answer needed
- Task 2: Understanding SMB
	- What does SMB stand for?
		- Server Message Block
	- What type of protocol is SMB?
		- response-request
	- What do clients connect to servers using?
		- TCP/IP
	- What systems does Samba run on?
		- Unix
- Task 3: Enumerating SMB
	- Conduct an **nmap** scan of your choosing, How many ports are open?
		- ![[nmap -sS 10.10.22.206.png]]
	- Used nmap -sS (SYN Scan) on 10.10.22.206 for a quick, stealthy, and accurate scan. 
		- 3
	- What ports is **SMB** running on?
		- 139/445
	- Let's get started with Enum4Linux, conduct a full basic enumeration. For starters, what is the **workgroup** name?
		- ![[enum4linux -a 10.10.22.206.png]]
		- ![[enum4linux output 1.png]]
		- WORKGROUP
	- What comes up as the **name** of the machine?
		- POLOSMB
	- What operating system **version** is running?
		- 6.1
	- What share sticks out as something we might want to investigate?
		- ![[enum4linux output 2.png]]
		- profiles
- Task 4: Exploiting SMB
	- What would be the correct syntax to access an SMB share called "secret" as user "suit" on a machine with the IP 10.10.10.2 on the default port?
		- smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445
	- Great! Now you've got a hang of the syntax, let's have a go at trying to exploit this vulnerability. You have a list of users, the name of the share (smb) and a suspected vulnerability.
		- No answer needed
	- Does the share allow anonymous access? Y/N?
		-  ![[Pasted image 20241222084214.png]]
		- Y
	- Great! Have a look around for any interesting documents that could contain valuable information. Who can we assume this profile folder belongs to?
		- ![[Pasted image 20241222084340.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241223074527.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241223075029.png]]
		- John Cactus
	- What service has been configured to allow him to work from home?
		- ssh
	- Okay! Now we know this, what directory on the share should we look in?
		- .ssh
	- This directory contains authentication keys that allow a user to authenticate themselves on, and then access, a server. Which of these keys is most useful to us?
		- ![[cd .ssh followed by ls.png]]
		- id_rsa
	- Download this file to your local machine, and change the permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]".
		- ![[Pasted image 20241223075519.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241223081504.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241223081545.png]]

	- Now, use the information you have already gathered to work out the username of the account. Then, use the service and key to log-in to the server.

	- What is the smb.txt flag?
